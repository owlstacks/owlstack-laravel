You are working on owlstack-laravel, a Laravel integration package for the Owlstack social media publishing platform.

This is a thin wrapper around owlstack/owlstack-core. All platform logic, formatting, and HTTP transport live in the core package. Do not duplicate core behavior.

Key conventions:
- PHP 8.1+ with declare(strict_types=1) in every file
- PSR-12 coding standard, PSR-4 autoloading
- Fully typed parameters and return types
- Readonly constructor promotion for value objects
- One class per file

Architecture:
- OwlstackServiceProvider registers core services into the Laravel container
- SendTo is the high-level publishing API (telegram(), twitter(), facebook(), etc.)
- Owlstack facade proxies to SendTo
- LaravelEventDispatcher bridges core events to Laravel's event system
- Config in config/owlstack.php, populated from .env
- Supports Laravel 10.x, 11.x, 12.x

Testing:
- Run: ./vendor/bin/phpunit or composer test
- Uses Orchestra Testbench for Laravel testing
- Mock HttpClientInterface to avoid real API calls
- Unit tests in tests/Unit/, feature tests in tests/Feature/

Do not:
- Duplicate platform logic from owlstack-core
- Hardcode API URLs or credentials
- Commit real API tokens
- Use dd(), var_dump, or print_r in production code
- Suppress errors with @
